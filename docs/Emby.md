TV-based apps often struggle to deliver optimal 4K playback because they may lack support for all codecs and audio formats.
```

For a smoother 4K experience, consider using a dedicated playback device like the Apple TV 4K or Fire TV Cube.
```

**Important:** Avoid using **PGSSUB** subtitles with 4K playback!

**Recommended Settings:**

- Settings -> Playback -> Video Quality.

- Internet quality: Set to **4K-200Mbps** or set max **streaming bitrate to maximum!**

- Maximum Allowed Video Transcoding Resolution: 4K.

For web app/generic android boxes:

## 💡 Tips

### 🏠︎ Tune your "Home"

Tune your "Home" website to get faster loadings:

- **Settings -> Home Screen Layout**.
  - Deselect libraries you don't need.


### 🔄 Alternative Emby Clients for Android

[Yamby Emby Official Telegram](https://t.me/yamby_release){:target="_blank"} (Yamby is much faster at searching, and if you don't care about the TV feature or extra subtitles, it's a great alternative to the Emby sideload.)

- **64-bit**: Downloader by AFTVnews code: **5473943**
- **32-bit**: Downloader by AFTVnews code: **2623077**

- For the Fire TV Stick 4K, use the 32-bit version. For other devices, start with the 64-bit version. If the installation fails, try the 32-bit version.
- There is a guide on how to add the Emby Server, but it’s in Chinese. You can use a web translator to access it: [Yamby Emby Server Guide (Translated)](https://wiki-freeembyguide-eu-org.translate.goog/docs/use/yamby/?_x_tr_sl=zh-CN&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl&_x_tr_pto=wapp){:target="_blank"}.
